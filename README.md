# Peo Webdesign
Redesign of a vtuber's website to practice responsive ui/ux. Created using TypeScript in Vite + React.  <br/>

This was made purely for practice and is not related to the official website. All rights to the images belong to the owners. Original website is https://www.yukinoshitapeo.com/.

# How to preview
To preview the webpage itself, you'll need to do the following:
1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Clone the repo
3. Run `npm install` in the project directory
4. Run `npm run dev`

Alternatively, if you want to build the project, you can do the following:
1. Run `$ npm run build` to build app
2. Run `$ npm run preview` to preview

For more information about building, please visit [Vite's guide](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy).
